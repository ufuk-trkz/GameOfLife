# Conway's GameOfLife

Game of Life is a cellular automaton invented by British mathematician John Conway (1937-2020). Itâ€™s a simulation of the behavior of populations (of pixels!) after creating an initial setup.

Rules:
1. Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The user can start with a random first genration, choose between 4 presets or create a new layout by briniging cell alive per tap on the grid.
The generations can be skiped step by step or automatically at the seleced time rate.
The user can also pause and edit the grid for the current generation.
